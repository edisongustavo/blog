Hello all,

My name is Edison Gustavo Muenz and I'm a Brazilian ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· that currently lives in Berlin.


My career path is:

1. Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· (left in Feb/2017)
1. South Africa ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦ (from March/2017 to Dec/2018)
1. Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª (from Jan/2019)

I want to talk about Software and more recently Machine Learning and NLP. Maybe something about local culture too.

I'm very interested in NLP lately because I've joined a team at Amazon that works on NLP and I'm finding it super exciting!

My interests:
- Software engineering
- Biking (road bikes! I have a [Sage Carbon Ultegra](https://www.radsport-rennrad.de/test-teile/test-radon-sage-carbon-ultegra/))
- NLP
- Gaming
